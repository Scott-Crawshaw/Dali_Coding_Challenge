# Dali Dashboard
## What I made
As my coding challenge submission, I made an Android app that displays information on the Dali lab students. In this app, there are three ways to visualize the data.


Option 1: A list of all the Dali lab students. You can click on a student to see their profile.

Option 2: A map with markers at all of the students respective hometowns. You can click on a marker to see the student's name, and click on the student's name to see their profile.

Option 3: A term selection page. When you select a term, it bring you to a list of all the students that are on that term. You can click on a student's name to see their profile.


The profile page contains the student's picture, their message, and a small interactive google map with a marker on their hometown. You can access the student's URL by clicking on their picture or their message.

## How to Use It
Download the file [Dali_Dashboard.apk](Dali_Dashboard.apk) onto your Android phone. Open the file to install the app. You may be prompted to edit your phone's settings in order to allow the installation of files downloaded from the internet.
